1. Food process everything until rough, coarse meal forms - between couscous and paste.
1. Refrigerate 1-2 hours.
1. Shape into balls - will stick together loosely at first, but will bind once begin to fry.
1. If won't bind, try processor again to make more paste-like.

## Pupusa

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

167g masa harina \
1tsp salt \
1 3/8 cup cold water \

Filling: \
3.75oz mozzarella \
1/4 cup jalapenos \
1/4 cup roasted butternut squash \
seasoning

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}

7 pupusas

:::

::::

*Method*

1. Whisk masa harina and salt.
1. Stir in water until mostly combined.
1. Using hand mix to very soft dough.
1. Flatten into balls, fill, seal. Aiming for 1/4 inch thick and 4inches diameter, from 2 x 2oz balls of dough.
1. Little oil in pan over medium heat. Cook for 4-6mins per side.

*Notes*

- Didn't use all the water because it made the dough very wet.
- Difficult to assemble - when to thin, dough breaks, so did some assembling/flattening in pan.
- But could maybe form/flatten between greaseproof paper?
- Had a lot of filling left over too. Maybe because difficulties getting big enough for more filling?
