2 x 8" round

*Method*

1. Whisk cocoa, sugar, vanilla and water until smooth and leave cool 5 mins. 
1. Cream butter and sugar, 3-5 mins, then beat in eggs 1 at a time. 
1. Fold in dry 1/3 at a time, then cooled cocoa mixture. 
1. Bake. 
1. For caramel, sugar and 6tbsp water in saucepan over medium heat, cook 6-8 mins no stirring, until starts to turn deep amber. 
1. Remove from heat and place in bowl cold water. 
1. Slowly whisk in cream and vanilla -> thick pouring consistency (can stir over heat if necessary). 
1. Stir in salt and leave to cool. 
1. For buttercream, whisk egg whites and sugar until smooth. 
1. Place over pan of simmering water for 5mins, whisking occasionally until sugar dissolves - feels smooth, not grainy between fingertips. 
1. Whisk about 7mins to stiff peaks. 
1. Add butter and whisk about 5mins, until smooth and glossy - don't panic if appears to curdle, just keep whisking. 
1. Add vanilla and 5 tbsp cooled caramel, 1tbsp at a time and mix until smooth.

*Notes*

- Not too chocolately or too sweet. 
- Buttercream very smooth and silky. Could do with less buttercream. 
- Caramel sauce did not work as stated - hard lumps of sugar and had to heat slowly to get mix with cream - next time would not dunk in cold water, but would add warm cream instead.
