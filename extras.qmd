::: {.column width="20%"}

:::

::::

*Method*

1. Add icing sugar and little milk to make stiffer or more spreadable.

*Notes*

- Can add vanilla, peppermint, lemon zest ...

##  Chocolate cremeux `r vegan` {#sec-chocolate-cremeux}

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}

:::

::::

*Method*

1. Whisk milk, sugar and cornflour over low heat until sugar is dissolved.
1. Add vanilla, coconut and salt, heat on medium-high. Simmer whilst whisking continuously for 5 mins until thickened.
1. Pour custard over chocolate and fold until melted. Whisk for a couple minutes until smooth and lump-free.
1. Chill.

*Notes*

- Make in advance - 6hours to chill, but overnight best.
- Enough for 2 layers of filling in a 3-tiered 7" round cake - like [chocolate and coffee woodland stump cake](#sec-woodland-stump).

##  Coffee Swiss meringue buttercream `r freezes` `r vegan` {#sec-coffee-swiss-buttercream}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

9tbs (133g) [aquafaba](#sec-aquafaba) \
220g light brown sugar \
250g butter \
1.5tbs coffee granules in 1tbs boiling water

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}

:::

::::

*Method*

1. Make coffee and set aside. 
1. Heat aquafaba and sugar in bowl over hot water. Bring temperature to medium and allow mixture to heat for few minutes until sugar is dissolved.
1. Whisk on high speed 15-20mins until completely cooled, stiff and glossy - should stay in upside down bowl.
1. Slowly add chunks of butter, one at a time, with 5 seconds between to allow it to incorporate.
1. Once all butter added, whisk on low 5-10mins until fluffy and lightened in colour. Don't worry if looks split, just beat more.
1. Add cooled coffee, beat a couple minutes until combined.

*Notes*

- Used to cover sides and top of 3-tiered 7" round cake - like [chocolate and coffee woodland stump cake](#sec-woodland-stump). But had lots leftover - think 2/3 would be enough.
- Should freeze (testing). Think defrost and mix before using.

120ml milk \

1. Melt all ingredients, except juice/alcohol, allowing butter to melt.
1. Simmer 10 mins, stirring occasionally.
1. Cool completely then add juice/alcohol.

should be able to store for up to three months.
