*Method*

1. Melt butter slowly. Take off heat then add sugar and milk. Sprinkle over yeast, stir, set aside couple mins.

1. Knead 5 mins to smooth, pliable dough.
1. Knead fruit a little at a time into dough until evenly distributed.

*Notes*

- I added a bit more flour to get soft ball.
- Could do with more fruit.
- Also, took a bit longer than suggested to prove.
- I accidentally made 11, because I went for ~90g a bun in shaping. So should go for ~83g instead to get 12.
- Didn't bother with crosses but after second prove and before bake can mix 25g strong white bread flour with 2tbs cold water to make smooth paste, then pipe over top.
