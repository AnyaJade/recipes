The goal of recipes is to be able to keep my recipes and notes in an accessible 
and shareable place: https://anyajade.github.io/recipes/

Icons for vegan and freezes come from [FontAwesome](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome). The quarto 
extension should be installed and saved in the `_extensions` folder.
